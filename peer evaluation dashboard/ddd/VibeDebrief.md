//Followed foudation first approach to build the project

    package.json - Like the blueprint of a house. Defines what tools and materials (dependencies) we need.

    vite.config.ts - The construction manager. Tells our build system how to assemble everything.

    MongoDB connection - The foundation/database. We need somewhere to store user data, courses, and quiz results.

    Server files - The backbone. Creates the API endpoints that will handle user login, course data, quiz submissions.

    Basic client files - The front door. A simple webpage that proves everything connects properly.
